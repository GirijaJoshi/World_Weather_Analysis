* After getting valuesw for latitude and longitude used WeatherMapAPI request using API key to get the information about the cities for latitude and logitude created in above step.
* Saved above created DataFram into WeatherPy_database.csv.

### Part 2: Have Customers Narrow Their Travel Searches Based on Temperature and Precipitation
* Got the information from WeatherPy_database.csv and converted into DataFrame
